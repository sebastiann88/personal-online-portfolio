        <h1>Collage with Mixed Media</h1>
        <div id="columns">
            <p>This mixed media collage was done in two steps: The creation and assembly of traditional mixed snippets of photos and type on the right, then the creation of the digital layout on the left. Finally it was then brought together and united to become one piece.</p>
            <p>The concept behind this collage was that I wanted to give the impression of fear and despair within the choice of phrases and with the type of imagery I picked to add the page. The use of very rough textured, ripped paper, distressed typefaces, and bold red colour used across the spread hopefully gives the alert and grim feel I was going after that would match the written content of the article.</p>
