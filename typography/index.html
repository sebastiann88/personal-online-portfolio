        <p>These projects will show you a taste of the typographic practice I use within my designs.</p>
        <p>I align the contents of the articles and spreads in a grid system. Then I arrange the layout of the spreads in a way that is pleasing to look at, engaging to read, and legible. With some layouts I have been a bit experimental and have moved certain elements outside of the established grid system, while keeping esthetical pleasing spacing and vertical rhythm in mind.</p>
