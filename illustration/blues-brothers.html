            <p>This project was an experimentation using the media of a pen and translating that medium into a pure black and white rendered illustration. This technique was inspired by the technique used in comic books where the pen drawings needed to be rendered at very high contrast for good legibility and print optimization.</p>
            <p>The concept behind the album is that I wanted to depict the rush and the amount of time the two brothers Jake and Elwood were on the road trying to group together their band. So I included drawn out arrows pointing around to different events, the other band members, and finally back again to the two brothers to hint that the main story always seems to lead back to the main two brothers.</p>
            <p>Creating this album involved drawing it out and then inking it on tracing paper and then rendering the inked drawing pure black and white in  Photoshop with the aid of a Wacom tablet to balance out the values.</p>
