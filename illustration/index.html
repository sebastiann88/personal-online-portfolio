        <p>These illustrations are a sample of the style I enjoy working in.</p>
        <p>Some of them are flat and graphic in nature such as the poster for Company and the Senators Campaign. While other styles are a bit more fluid using strokes and subtle gradients mixed with the medium such as in the Tennis Serve. I also enjoy coming with the initial design I will illustrate on paper and in one sample illustration I show how the final rendering was based off the rendered ink drawings.</p>
