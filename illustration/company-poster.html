            <p>This poster was illustrated as part of a contest entry among designers to create an engaging expressive poster for the play taking place at Kalish Mital Theatre at Carleton University. The play features a colourful lively event with humor that takes place in New York city. So I wanted my illustrative poster to share the same character.</p>
