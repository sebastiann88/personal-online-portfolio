    <div id="columns">
        <p>During my time at Algonquin College I have created some interesting interactive projects.</p>
        <p>One project included building an interactive dvd main menu, another involved building a website mockup in Photoshop for an ecommerce website. Other projects even involved designing a toy for a very young demographic with the focus on developing an intuitive and simple user experience. We also created a mockup for an ipad game where we considered how the user would interact with the interface. More recent projects involved the creation of two iphone apps.</p>
