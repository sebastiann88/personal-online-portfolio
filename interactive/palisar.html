            <p>This was a mock-up created for a fictitious e-commerce website called Palisar. The website serves to sell snowboarding goods such as snowboards, jackets, T-shirts, pants, goggles, cloves, boots, bindings, etc.</p>
            <p>This was my earlier practice of creating full website mock-ups in Photoshop. I included this piece because it was a more fully fleshed out mock-up than my more recent mock-ups. Now when I create websites, I simply do the mock-ups on paper, and then build the interactive prototype directly in the browser. It saves a step and allows for a much quicker workflow.</p>
