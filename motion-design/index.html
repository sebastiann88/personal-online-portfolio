        <h1>Motion Design</h1>
        <p>I really love motion design and I plan on developing my skills further in this area.</p>
        <p>I would like to bring sound animation principles woven into graphic design to create beautiful artistic motion graphics. I have some interesting projects posted up that serve to communicate a message through typography and moving graphics. I have my demo reel, a broadcast opener, an explainer video, as well as an animated infographic. These videos were created using After Effects and Illustrator. In the future I also plan on incorporating 3D into my work with Cinema 4D.</p>
