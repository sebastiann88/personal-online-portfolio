            <p>This video was part of my co-op placement in College to create an engaging teaser for an instructional video on how to prepare a portfolio to enter the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College.</p>
            <p>I used the school brand colours and typeface throughout the video while incorporating illustrative assets to explain the different aspects of what goes into making and preparing a graphic design portfolio. The supervisor I had working with me was Diane Banks who was in charge of the marketing department at the College and she watched over the production of the video and offered me feedback as well.</p>
